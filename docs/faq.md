Not completely. Meteor is a freemium bot, which means that some features are free, while others require a subscription. You can view the pricing on our discord server.

Meteor has a system called botbans, if anyone is doing something that is against our rules, we will ban the user from using the bot. If you think you were banned by mistake, please contact us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fVhYe98YPu).
