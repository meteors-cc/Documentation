# Welcome to Meteor Bot Documentation

Thank you for choosing Meteor! This guide will provide you with all the information you need to get started and make the most out of your new Discord bot.

## Getting Started

To begin using Meteor, you’ll need to add it to your Discord server. You can do this by visiting [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1204521878241419324) and selecting the server you’d like to add it to. Once Meteor has been added to your server, you can start using it right away.

## Modules

Meteor is a modular bot, which means that you can enable or disable specific features based on your needs. On the left-hand side of this page, you’ll find a list of modules that you can enable or disable. Simply click on a module to view more information about it and enable or disable it as needed.

## Special Thanks

We’d like to extend a special thanks to all of our users who have supported us throughout the development of Meteor. Your feedback and suggestions have been invaluable, and we look forward to continuing to improve the bot based on your input.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fVhYe98YPu). We’re here to help and ensure that you have the best possible experience with Meteor.
